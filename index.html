  <h2>The goose that laid the golden eggs</h2>

  <div class="main-content">
    <div class="text-content">
      <p>A Man and his Wife had the good fortune to possess a Goose which laid a Golden Egg every day. Lucky though they were, they soon began to think they were not getting rich fast enough, and, imagining the bird must be made of gold inside, they decided to kill it in order to secure the whole store of precious metal at once. But when they cut it open they found it was just like any other goose. Thus, they neither got rich all at once, as they had hoped, nor enjoyed any longer the daily addition to their wealth.</p>

  <h2>The fox and the vizor mask</h2>

<div class="text-content">
  <p>A fox while walking out one day,

Into a toy shop chanced to stray;

Among the toys that stood arrayed,

A vizor mask was there displayed,

With rosy cheeks, complexion fair,

And ruby lips and auburn hair,

And eyes of blue, and Grecian nose;

And many beauties to disclose,

It seemed made. The fox, with sighs,

Gazed on. "Ah, ah!" he cries,

[111]"Look at this head it naught contains,

It has rare beauty, but no brains."</p>
  <p>The accomplished beau, in air and mien how blest.

His hat well fashioned, and his hair well dress'dâ€”

But still undress'd within: to give him brains

Exceeds his hatter's or his barber's pains.</p>

  <p class="fable-moral">If you are wise you won't be deceived by the innocent airs of those whom you have once found to be dangerous.</p>

  <h2>The lion and the echo</h2>

  <p>A lion, bravest of the wood,

Whose title undisputed stood,

As o'er the wide domains he prowl'd,

And in pursuit of booty growl'd,

An Echo from a distant cave

Regrowl'd, articulately grave:

His majesty, surprised, began

To think at first it was a man;

[80]But on reflection sage, he found

It was too like a lion's sound.

"Whose voice is that which growls at mine?"

His highness ask'd. Says Echo, "Mine!"

"Thine!" says the Lion: "Who art thou?"

Echo as stern cried, "Who art thou?"

"Know I'm a lion, hear and tremble!"

Replied the king. Cried Echo, "Tremble!"

"Come forth," says Lion; "show thyself."

Laconic Echo answered, "Elf."

"Elf, durst thou call me, vile pretender?"

Echo as loud replies, "Pretender!"

At this, as jealous of his reign,

He growl'd in rage; she growl'd again.

Incensed the more, he chafed and foam'd,

And round the spacious forest roam'd

To find the rival of his throne,

Who durst with him dispute the crown.

A fox, who listen'd all the while,

Address'd the monarch with a smile:

[81]"My liege, most humbly I make bold,

Though truth may not be always told,

That this same phantom which you hear,

That so alarms your royal ear,

Is not a rival of your throne:

The voice and fears are all your own."

Imaginary terrors scare

A timorous soul with real fear;

Nay, even the wise and brave are cow'd

By apprehensions from the crowd:

A frog a lion may disharm,

And yet how causeless the alarm!
